# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to build a simple **Machine Learning model** in Python to predict house prices based on features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. It uses **Linear Regression** from the `scikit-learn` library.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal is to predict house prices using supervised learning. We use a CSV dataset containing house data and train a model to predict prices for new inputs.

## 📁 Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection
- Train/Test splitting
- Model training using Linear Regression
- Model evaluation (R² score, MSE)
- Predicting custom house prices
